# Ovation Ecology Field Data Importer

[Ovation](http://ovation.io "ovation.io") is the revolutionary data management service that empowers researchers through the seamless organization of multiple data formats and sources, preservation of the link between raw data and analyses and the ability to securely share of all of this with colleagues and collaborators.

This project provides a Python package for importing field data, recorded in CSV format, into Ovation. The importer leverages the [Pandas](http://http://pandas.pydata.org/ "Pandas") package for reading and manipulating CSV data.
